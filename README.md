This C++ project aims to create a straightforward task list application. It employs two primary classes: Task for individual tasks and TaskList for managing collections of tasks. Users interact with the application via a menu-driven interface, allowing them to add tasks, mark them as completed, and view the task list. The project serves as an introduction to object-oriented programming concepts in C++, showcasing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It provides a solid starting point for further development of more sophisticated task management systems, including features like task prioritization and file storage.
